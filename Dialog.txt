Beginning

  The theme is You only get one.

  My immediate thought is "You only get one bullet", which is kind of sad except.

  I've got an idea for a game where you are your projectile.  You fire one shot and when the shot reaches the target
  you teleport to that spot.

  And until that bullet reaches the spot you have no more ammunition, unless you teleport to the projectiles current position.

  I don't want to fall back on 2 player, so I will need to write an AI.

  If I can get an AI up and running early, then I can tweak gameplay more easily as I go along.

  Going to get some water.

  However, shooting kind of bores me.

  I like the idea of a teleporting mechanic based on a projectile timing system.

  Maybe it is not a shooter but a top down mystical exploration game.

  You use your teleportation to navigate jump puzzles.

  That could have a very clean but interesting art style.

  The projectile could be a magical ball that you throw, and "you only get one".  If you throw it too far/off screen/into the abyss, you 


  I'll get a prototype up and running.

  But first git.

Technical Issues

  Ditched Coffeescript because of "this" issues.
  Ditched DOM manipulation, because of desire to use art assets, and lack of experience might slow me down for no benefit. (DOM would be slower than canvas)

Art Phase 1

  Had the idea that the game would be set in a "temple" and that the idea of the game was to explore it with the teleportation
  ability.

  Ended up drawing a wierd horse woman lady in bright purple.  Then got rid of the 2nd pair of legs.  Discovered a cool leaning style.
  After turning onion skin on and off again, I could see a potential art SFX for doing teleportation

  Woman can always be leaning, ready to go.  Turning Head.  4 Directions.  Then she lunges further and teleports and only slightly relaxs in the new spot.

  So this means no walking at all.  Which I like, focus on teleportation.

  Now to get something into the """game?"""

Telporting... What next?

  A creature that can teleport.
  What would they desire?

  Without objects around them, there is no way for them to know their place in the world.
  There is no way for them to know where they were, or where they are going.

  There are stones in the wild.  You can venture into the nothingness.  And carry them, and place them.
  And make a home.

  Others of your kind, do not understand the importance you place on a home.

  Without the stones, you have no sense of place.  You are lost.  There is no map.

    Teleport onto stones to carry them.  Teleport again to drop them in place.
    Teleport through invaders to protect your home.

Teleporting... pt2

  You start the game.  You are surrounded by nothing but white.

    You can teleport, but it is hard to tell that that is what you are doing, until you leave the screen in any direction.

    The screens around you have stones, the screen to the top left has one, the screen to the bottom right has 7.

    You discover, 

      that you can pick up a stone if you land near it.  
      And when you land again, the stone will come with you.

    You may move rocks around, you may venture out.  To discover a variety of objects.  Markers on your journey.
    But where are you going?

    You make your move.  And venture into the unknown. / You return home, to the home you have made.

    You have amassed many coloured objects, but what is it for?  What is the purpose or goal of this exercise?

    Where is the conflict?  Where is the tension?

      You discover, 

        that dropping a white stone clears the surrounding area.
        And dropping a coloured stone, colours the surrounding area.

        You discover, 

          that dropping a white stone, destroys it.
          that amassing all seven colours creates a white stone.

            that white stones are therefore, more valuable than other stones.



Level Layout?

  You teleport you lose one teleport.

  You collect teleports when you move through them, or land on them.

  When you collect all the stones.  The portal opens to the next level.


  There are two types of items.  Teleport fuel, and gems.

  One jump uses one fuel.  You need to collect all the gems to open the door.
  Which takes you to the next level.  A kin to Jetpack?


  A gem looks like *, fuel looks like o.

  You can collect multiple fuel items by warping through them.


  [ ] = podium
   x = start
   o = fuel
   * = gem

New Rules

  - You have teleport fuel.  One teleport uses one fuel.
  - You collect all the gems to open the door, to finish a level.
  - If your teleball leaves the screen it wraps around back into you.
  - You cannot move without teleporting.
  - You can restart the level with the R key. //Detect when stranded, prompt player to restart (like osmos)
  - You always land in the centre of an island, even if your teleball was on the edge of it.
  - The door opens when there are no more gems.
  - Use Jquery + HTML for Menus, pause the game if the $('.menu') is visible.
  - Need to be able to reset object states easily.

Visuals

  - Islands could look like this.  Rippling square waves.

Theme:
 You only get one teleport.
 So it is easy to become stranded if you don't plan your route.

 The game could be called Stranded? 


Reset state.

In the model and views initialize function, they can clone themselves and store it as a backup. 

If the art assets aren't static, can use frame.js
